-- Lecture 5: Lists. We should know all about lists. DO WE?


-- Exercise 1: Let's write a function that accepts two ordered lists and merges them.

--merge [1, 3, 5] [2, 4, 6] =>>> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]




-- Exercise 2: Write a function accepting a list of Integers and returning a tuple of two integer lists - odd and even.

--spltiPlz [1, 2, 3] =>>> ([1,3], [2])




-- Exercise 3: Let's write a function that checks if a string starts with another,

--isPrefix "cat" "dog" => False
--isPrefix "ca" "cat" => True





-- Exercise 4: Let's write an fn that returns the number of occurrences of the smallest number in it.

--occurrencesMin [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 1] =>>> 4
